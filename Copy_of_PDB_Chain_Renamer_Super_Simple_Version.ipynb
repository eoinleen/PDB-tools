        "What does this thing do?\n",
        "-----------------------\n",
        "Changes any chain designation in a PDB file to any other chain designation!\n",
        "Currently set up to change E→A and F→B, but can change ANY chain to ANY other chain.\n",
        "Changes both the chain ID and the segment ID at the same time.\n",
        "Saves a new file with 'mod_' at the start of the name.\n",
        "\n",
        "What do you need?\n",
        "---------------\n",
        "1. A PDB file with any chain designations you want to change\n",
        "2. The file must be in your Google Drive\n",
        "3. That's it!\n",
        "\n",
        "Where do I put stuff?\n",
        "-------------------\n",
        "1. Your PDB file goes in a folder in your Google Drive\n",
        "2. The script will save the new file in the same folder\n",
        "3. Example path: /content/drive/MyDrive/your_folder/your_file.pdb\n",
        "\n",
        "What do I need to change in the code?\n",
        "----------------------------------\n",
        "TWO things:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The chain mapping (if you want something other than E→A and F→B):\n",
        "  Look for this line:\n",
        "  chain_map={'E': 'A', 'F': 'B'}\n",
        "\n",
        "  Change it to whatever you want, for example:\n",
        "  chain_map={'A': 'X', 'B': 'Y'}  # This would change chain A to X and B to Y\n",
        "  chain_map={'C': 'A'}  # This would just change chain C to A\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The file location:\n",
        "  Look for this line near the bottom:\n",
        "  input_pdb_file = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/PDB-files/PDB-files-for-mod/3NOB-EF/3NOB-EF.pdb\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  Change it to point to your PDB file like:\n",
        "  input_pdb_file = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/your_folder/your_file.pdb\"\n",
        "\n",
        "What will I get?\n",
        "--------------\n",
        "1. A new PDB file that:\n",
        "  - Has the same name as your input but with 'mod_' at the start\n",
        "  - Has all chain designations changed according to your chain_map\n",
        "  - Works properly in PyMOL\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Input:  protein.pdb (with chains C and D)\n",
        "Output: mod_protein.pdb (with chains X and Y, if you set chain_map={'C': 'X', 'D': 'Y'})\n",
        "It should be able to handle lots of chains, not just 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "How do I know it worked?\n",
        "----------------------\n",
        "The script will:\n",
        "1. Tell you how many lines it processed\n",
        "2. Show you the first few lines before and after\n",
        "3. Tell you exactly where it saved the new file\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Problems:\n",
        "--------------\n",
        "1. \"File not found\": Double-check your file path\n",
        "2. \"Error reading file\": Make sure your PDB file isn't corrupted\n",
